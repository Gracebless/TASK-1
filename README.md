# TASK-1
This project demonstrates how to integrate a public API using Python to fetch real-time data and visualize it using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn. The project uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, etc.) for a given city and then presents that data in a clean and interpretable format.
