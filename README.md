DESCRIPTION:
Weather Forecast Visualizer is a Python-based application that fetches and visualizes 5-day/3-hour interval weather forecasts using the OpenWeatherMap API. Given a city name, it retrieves temperature, humidity, and weather condition data, processes it into a clean format using pandas, and creates insightful visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.

TOOLS USED:
requests-	To send HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API
pandas-	For data manipulation and tabular representation
matplotlib-	For basic plotting and graph customization
seaborn	-For advanced and styled statistical visualizations
datetime-	To convert Unix timestamps into readable datetime
OpenWeatherMap-	Public API used to retrieve real-time forecast data

WHAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED:
You can expand this project meaningfully while staying well under 500 lines of Python code. Here are some ideas:

 1. User Input / Dynamic City Selection
Let the user enter the city name via input() or a small GUI (e.g., tkinter).

 2. More Visualizations
Line plot for Pressure and Wind Speed

Grouped bar plot comparing morning/evening temperatures.

Heatmap of temperature by day & time.

 3. Weather Summary Insights
Print average, max, and min temperature.

Predict which day has highest rain chance.

Simple natural language weather summary (e.g., "Mostly sunny with occasional clouds").

 4. Export Options
Save data as .csv for later use.

Export visualizations as .png or .pdf.

 5. Multi-city Comparison
Accept multiple cities and generate comparative plots.

 6. Error Handling & Validation
Gracefully handle API failures, wrong city names, network errors.
